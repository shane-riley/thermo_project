# Thermo Project (Shane and Gabe) -- Core Assumptions

- Fix temperature differentials for CFH, HEX, Condenser at minimum (3 vars)
- Use max parameters for first turbine (2 vars)
- Use max reheat temperature (1 var)
- Trap is a constant enthalpy device (1 var)
- Avoid subcooled liquid at all costs (try to fix pumps at saturated liquid, prob not lp2 though) (2 vars)
